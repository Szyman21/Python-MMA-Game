# Python MMA Game Leader
<p><b>Hello World!</b></p>
This is my first "bigger" project in Python language. I have pleasure to show you game about mixed martial arts, where you need write name and surname of your character and chance to win by knockout, submission and decision.
You will write four characters and after that machine will choose a winner by leader solution. This simple programme will sum all scores which you writed and that will be something what decide who will be winner.
Furthermore, I gave a variety, machine will show what technique of win are was and when every battle ended. Winners of first two fights will fight each other in "Main Event".
